## Features

- You can tap on a pokemon to see what it's super effective and weak against, as well as suggestions of pokemon to use when attacking that particular pokemon
- You can search for the pokemon's name to find it more easily rather than scrolling

## Resources

- Code structure and sample code are largely based off [Apple's sample project to learn SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views)
- The data and images are all from the [pokemon.json](https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json) project
